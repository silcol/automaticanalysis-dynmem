% AA module - coregistration of EPI to structural with unwarping
% [aap,resp]=aamod_pewarp_write(aap,task,subj,sess)
% Ideally preceded by aamod_coreg_extended, to increase rigid alignment!
%% README
%   1) After running aamod_coregister_unwarp the functional and structural
% images are coregistered, so you can directly feed them into
% normalisation.
%   2) It is assumed that the structural has been brain extracted (with BET,
% BSE, etc.), and ideally bias corrected. The mean EPI is bias corrected
% within the script 
%   3) This has only been tested with SPM8. 
%   4) mex_pewarpcost_regularised is a compiled function that is built for 
% Matlab 7.8. It will probably not work in older versions. If you want to 
% recompile you can use the buildC99ompblas script, but it's probably quite
% a hassle as you'll need a recent version of gcc.
